# numerics_matlab
Same as numerics (if only slightly less extensive\reliable) and was meant more as experimentation on my part.

You'll find most of the functions are implemented on a much more basic level, and have additional features for showing off their internal mechanics. I find the examples here more informative than the ones in c++ if you want to see what is actually happening in each algorithm.
