# numerics_matlab
Functions here are the same ones as in numerics (if only slightly less extensive\reliable) and was meant more as experimentation/exploration on my part. Most functions are not present, though.

You'll find most of the functions are implemented on a much more basic level, and have additional features for showing off their internal mechanics I find the examples here more informative than the ones in c++ if you want to see what is actually happening in each algorithm -- so I guess this is educational.
